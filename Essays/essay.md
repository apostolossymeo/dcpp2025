# Technofeudal Dependencies and the Illusion of Digital Sovereignty  
*Can Public Digital Commons Exist on Privately-Owned Infrastructures?*

</div>



Modern states face a structural contradiction: they proclaim “digital sovereignty”  -  the capacity to control national data, infrastructure, and digital decision-making  -  while operating almost entirely atop infrastructures owned by foreign hyperscale corporations. This synthesis argues that this contradiction is not merely a strategic vulnerability but a symptom of a deeper political-economic transformation, described as Technofeudalism. In this system, Big Tech no longer behaves like firms in a competitive market, but rather like infrastructural landlords  controlling the terrain on which economic and governmental activity unfolds.

Through an analysis of technofeudalism, the ownership of the internet's  physical backbone (subsea cables and satellites), the legal extraterritoriality of cloud computing, and the successes and failures of European autonomy initiatives (Gaia-X, Tchap, Matrix), this report argues that "Digital Commons" cannot function as sovereign entities when they are guests on "technofeudal" estates. To reclaim meaningful autonomy, states must pivot from defensive regulation toward offensive investment in Public Digital Infrastructure (PDI) and a publicly governed “EuroStack”, treating open-source maintenance as a national security imperative rather than a charitable act. 

## 1. The Diagnosis: Technofeudal Enclosure

States often interpret their loss of digital power as a temporary governance gap, solvable by “catch-up regulation”. This misreads the nature of the problem. What is at stake is not a delay in policymaking but a transfer of territory: the foundational layers of digital life have shifted from public or collectively governed infrastructures to privately owned “estates”.

Political economists such as Varoufakis and Durand describe this as *Technofeudalism*: the *“Cloudalists”* (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) do not merely operate within markets; they own and govern the markets themselves. They control the physical backbone (subsea cables, data centres, satellites), the logical backbone (cloud orchestration, identity, API ecosystems), and the economic backbone (billing, access, prioritisation). Any Digital Common that runs on this substrate is therefore hosted inside someone else’s jurisdiction. *It is not a sovereign common but a tolerated enclave.*

### 1.1 The Enclosure of the Commons

Historically, commons disappeared not because people stopped sharing, but because land was enclosed. The decisive move was not behavioural but territorial. The same dynamic now applies digitally.

When a state migrates core functions — health records, citizen registries, tax systems — onto a hyperscaler’s cloud, it is not merely purchasing a service; it is relocating state capacity onto privately owned land. The state retains responsibility for what happens on the land, but not authority over the land itself. Formally, it is a customer with a contract; materially, it is a vassal with obligations.

This has three direct consequences for Digital Commons:

I. **Revocability**: The platform owner can terminate services, change terms, or restrict access. A “commons” that can be shut down by a commercial decision is not a commons; it is a revocable lease.

II. **Extractive visibility**: Telemetry, metadata, and usage patterns generated by public systems and commons-based tools feed the hyperscaler’s optimisation engines and surveillance capabilities. The most valuable layer - systemic intelligence - accrues to the landlord, not the community.

III. **Asymmetrical risk**: Infrastructural failures, security incidents, or geopolitical conflicts unfold under foreign commercial and legal authority, not democratic control.

In a crisis, these infrastructures fall under commercial and foreign legal control, not under the will of the polity that depends on them. A Digital Common running on such land can never be more sovereign than its host.

### 1.2 The Limits of Regulatory Sovereignty

Europe’s primary response to this imbalance has been regulation: the GDPR, the DMA, the DSA, and the AI Act. These instruments discipline platform behaviour, but they do not change the fact that the territory itself remains privately owned. Regulation presupposes an underlying capacity to act — the ability to operate critical systems even when commercial relations or geopolitical alignments break down.

Today, Europe is strong on rules but weak on the conditions that would make those rules enforceable, facing:

I. **Infrastructure dependence**: Hyperscalers provide the majority of cloud services for European administrations. This creates an infrastructural veto: if relations sour, the landlord can threaten the tenant.

II. **Legal extraterritoriality**: The U.S. CLOUD Act allows American authorities to access data held by U.S. companies regardless of where the servers are physically located. “Data residency” inside the EU does not imply political control.

III. **Operational lock-in**: Proprietary identity, analytics, and orchestration layers create deep technical dependencies, even when some components — such as Linux or Kubernetes — are nominally open source.

For Digital Commons, this means existing in a hostile property regime. They may be celebrated rhetorically, but remain legally and technically subordinated to the platforms that host them.

## 2. Digital Commons on Borrowed Land

The central question for Digital Commons is not what they are, but where they live. A commons requires more than open code or open standards; it requires territory where collective governance is binding. When the infrastructure layer is privately owned, the commons remains structurally fragile — subject to enclosure, repricing, surveillance, or eviction at the owner’s discretion.

Two European experiments illustrate this tension clearly. Gaia-X was launched as a project of European cloud sovereignty, yet it never built its own substrate. By admitting U.S. hyperscalers as core participants, it evolved into a certification layer applied to existing corporate infrastructures. From a commons perspective, this was sovereignty without land: rules without ownership. Rather than displacing technofeudal power, Gaia-X legitimised it.

The French government’s adoption of the Matrix protocol for its Tchap messenger points further but not far enough. While the protocol is open and federated, the surrounding ecosystem — hosting, maintenance, security, and developer labour — remains underfunded and partially dependent on private infrastructure. The commons is used, but not fully sustained.

The lesson is consistent: without owned territory and durable public investment, Digital Commons are either captured or slowly eroded, never truly sovereign.

## 3. Policy Recommendations: Building the “EuroStack”

For European states to move from cloud tenants to sovereign architects, Digital Commons must be treated as core infrastructure rather than lightweight policy add-ons. This requires a shift from symbolic support to material commitment.

First, public funding must prioritise maintenance, not just innovation. The German Sovereign Tech Fund demonstrates how financing long-term upkeep of critical open-source components prevents dependence on corporate sponsorship. Without stable maintenance funding, commons projects are pushed toward commercial hosting arrangements that gradually re-enclose them.

Second, the EuroStack should be built as commons territory. At the hardware layer, this means investment in open architectures and publicly governed cables. At the middleware layer, public procurement should mandate interoperable standards deployed on infrastructure the public sector can control or replicate. At the application layer, governments should favour Public-Common Partnerships with ecosystems such as Nextcloud and Matrix.

Finally, “Public Money = Public Code” must be extended to include public land. Publicly funded code should, wherever possible, run on publicly governed infrastructure. Otherwise, the state merely finances commons it must rent back from technofeudal landlords.

## 4. *Conclusion*

The question of whether public commons can exist on private infrastructure is answered by the current reality: they cannot. As long as the digital terrain is controlled by foreign monopolies (*technofeudal rent extraction*), “digital sovereignty” remains illusory. A Digital Common hosted on AWS is not a Common; it is a tenant, subject to eviction or enclosure at the whim of the landlord.

The alternative is clear: states must stop acting as customers of Big Tech and start acting as architects of Public Digital Infrastructure. This does not mean state-run capitalism, but rather the state as a guarantor of the Digital Commons — funding open protocols, maintaining shared code, and owning the critical pipes of the digital republic.

The tools exist. What is missing is the political will to reclaim the digital realm not as a private fiefdom, but as a *res publica*.
